        <h1>Blog Post</h1>
        <p>this is my first time trying to code a webpage inside of a docker container running on a raspberry pi</p>
        <h2>How was this achieved?</h2>
        <p>this was achieved by the following</p>
        <ol>
            <li>first setting up the raspberry pi</li>
            <li>loading a docker container</li>
            <li>using linuxserver.io's vscode server image</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The rough start</h2>
        <p>starting the container and getting everything working was easy, but I kept running into a problem with git, before realizing after a few hours that i hadn't set git up properly.</p>
        <p>I've had prior experience in making a docker image before, using a raspberry pi zero 2 running pihole, but haven't really touched it much besides pulling new images and recreating them.</p>
        <h2>Whats next from here?</h2>
        <p>I plan on continuing testing out and adding more docker images to my raspberry pi 4 8gb model as a test bench, then have them set up on a dedicated cluster.</p>
        <p>Here's the list of things I want to do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>use of heimdall container</li>
            <li>start using kubernetes</li>
            <li>understand Ansible</li>
            <li>add an apache server container(?)</li>
            <ul><li>currently this is being served onto github pages, I'd like to have it moved to my pi and have it as a container based webserver</li></ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
