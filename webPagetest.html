        <h1>Blog Post</h1>
        <p>this is my first time trying to code a webpage inside of a docker container running on a raspberry pi</p>
        <h2>How was this achieved?</h2>
        <p>this was achieved by the following</p>
        <ol>
            <li>first setting up the raspberry pi</li>
            <li>loading a docker container</li>
            <li>using linuxserver.io's vscode server image</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The rough start</h2>
        <p>starting the container and getting everything working was easy, but I kept running into a problem with git, before realizing after a few hours that i hadn't set git up properly.</p>
        <p>I've had prior experience in making a docker image before, using a raspberry pi zero 2 running pihole, but haven't really touched it much besides pulling new images and recreating them.</p>
        <h2>Whats next from here?</h2>
        <p>I plan on continuing testing out and adding more docker images to my raspberry pi 4 8gb model as a test bench, then have them set up on a dedicated cluster.</p>
        <p>Here's the list of things I want to do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>use of heimdall container</li>
            <li>start using kubernetes</li>
            <li>understand Ansible</li>
            <li>add an apache server container(?)</li>
            <ul><li>currently this is being served onto github pages, I'd like to have it moved to my pi and have it as a container based webserver</li></ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Journey so far</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>imaged a RasPiOS Lite 64 bit onto pi 4 8gb model</li>
            <li>52 pi wiki for EP-0152 board oled setup and fan control</li>
            <ul><li>also looked at another youtuber's video on having the fan speed up and slow down, but created too much of a buzzing noise, so i just opted for the regular in-built fan controls via raspi-config</li></ul>
            <li>followed instructions from TechCraft youtube to enable usb-c OTG</li>
            <li>created bash aliases</li>
            <ul>
                <li>alias stress="stress-ng --cpu 4 --cpu-method fft"</li>
                <li>alias temp="watch -n 1 vcgencmd measure_temp; vcgencmd measure_volts; vcgencmd get_throttled"</li>
                <li>alias shutdown="sudo shutdown -h now"</li>
            </ul>
            <li>ssh keygen copy to pi without having to constantly enter password</li>
            <li>install docker, create docker-compose.yml file, set up code-server using linuxserver.io's docker image</li>
            <li>created git and uploaded repo</li>
            <li>started configuring an efficient VNC without using raspi-config's built in realVNC enable</li>
            <ul>
                <li>used a script from <a href="https://github.com/gitbls/RPiVNCHowTo">https://github.com/gitbls/RPiVNCHowTo</a></li>
                <li>one problem I ran into was that I couldn't find the wifi icon(still cant) and at some point the wlan0 interface stopped working completely</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I had to end up re-typing ssid and password using raspi-config for it to work again, but im not sure why it was like that as the information was already inside of wpa_supplicant</li>
                </ul>
                <li>KDE-Plasma might be too heavy for the pi, so I'm going to try to trim it back down to XFCE or something</li>
            </ul>
            <li>tested deploy keys in github on my pi and ipad to see how pushing code through git using the keys works</li>
            <ul>
                <li>initially I created a separate key inside of the container thinking that it would work but it still kept asking for my login credentials, until i changed the keys to my ipad's key</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
